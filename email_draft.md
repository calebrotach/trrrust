# Email Draft: Trust Automation Research Summary

**Subject:** Announcing: Trust Automation Research Platform

Hi team,

I'm excited to share the trust automation research platform I've been building. This is a work in progress, but I wanted to roll it out to the group so we can start exploring it together.

**What this is:**
I've dissected 25+ trust types into modular components and built a comprehensive analysis framework. The platform shows how we can build a trust automation system by identifying which modules are needed to cover different percentages of trust types.

**What you'll find:**
- **MVP Definition**: Top 8 most-used modules that provide our baseline coverage
- **Coverage Analysis**: Complete breakdown of how many modules are needed to reach 10%, 20%, 30%... all the way to 100% coverage
- **Trust Type Database**: Detailed analysis of popular trusts (ILIT, Revocable, GRAT, CRT, Bypass, QTIP, Dynasty, etc.) with step-by-step flows
- **Modular Architecture**: Framework showing how every trust is built from reusable modules (revocability, tax treatment, distribution methods, etc.)

**The opportunity:**
Instead of building separate systems for each trust type, we can build a modular platform where trusts are assembled from reusable components. This dramatically reduces development time and allows us to support new trust types by combining existing modules.

**What's ready:**
I have a working demo that visualizes the research, shows trust flows, and calculates MVP coverage. The core framework is solid, though I'm still refining the analysis and adding more trust types.

Take a look and let me know what you think. I'm happy to walk through it together or dive deeper into any part of the research.

Best,
[Your name]
